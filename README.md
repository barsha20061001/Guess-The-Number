# 🎮 GUESS-THE-NUMBER
🎯 Guess the Number is a fun and interactive browser-based game built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The objective is simple: the player must guess a randomly generated number between 1 and 100. With only 🔟 attempts available, the game challenges users to think logically and strategically. After each guess, the player receives helpful feedback indicating whether the number is too high 📈, too low 📉, or correct ✅. The interface also displays previous guesses and the number of remaining attempts, keeping the user fully engaged. Once the game ends—either by guessing the number or using all attempts—the player can easily restart and try again 🔁. This project is perfect for beginners looking to practice DOM manipulation, event handling, and simple game logic using vanilla JavaScript. It's lightweight, responsive, and runs entirely in the browser—no frameworks or libraries required! 💻
